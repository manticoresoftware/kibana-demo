This repository provides a ready-to-use setup to demonstrate the integration of [Manticore Search](https://manticoresearch.com/) with [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana). It also enables a performance comparison between two Kibana instances connected to Elasticsearch and Manticore, respectively. 

The demo utilizes a set of Kibana visualizations inspired by [this popular blog post](https://ruan.dev/blog/2019/04/02/setup-kibana-dashboards-for-nginx-log-data-to-understand-the-behavior), which is based on data from an Nginx access log file. The [kscarlett-generator](https://github.com/kscarlett/nginx-log-generator) tool is used to generate fake data for the log file.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manticoresoftware/kibana-demo.git
cd kibana-demo
```

### Configure the Environment

Edit the .env file to choose between using pre-built Elasticsearch and Manticore indexes or generating a new log file and building new indexes based on it.

#### Pre-Built Indexes

If you choose this option, prepared Elasticsearch and Manticore indexes will be downloaded from GitHub (data volume ~13GB). Note that this process may take some time. 

Set the following in .env:

```bash
REGENERATE_LOG=0
```


#### Generate a New Log File

If you choose to generate a new log file, data loading into Elasticsearch and Manticore may also take significant time, especially if a large number of log entries are configured.

Set the following in .env:

```bash
REGENERATE_LOG=1
LOG_ENTRY_COUNT=100000
```

#### Update Log Data

Additionally, you can update the indexes with new log entries to simulate real-time log behavior. Use the UPDATE_RATE option to define how many log entries are added per second. To disable this feature, set `UPDATE_RATE` to 0:

```bash
UPDATE_RATE=1
```

#### Custom ports

You can configure custom ports for the Elasticsearch and Manticore Kibana instances by setting these options in `.env`:

```bash
ES_KIBANA_PORT=5612
MANTICORE_KIBANA_PORT=5613
```

### Launch the environment

Run the startup script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Wait until the log generation or index loading process is complete.

Verify the services are running:
- Kibana with Elasticsearch : http://localhost:5612
- Kibana with Manticore : http://localhost:5613

### Import Kibana objects

If you generated a new index, import the pre-built visualizations into Kibana.

For the Elasticsearch Kibana instance:

- Go to *Management > Saved objects* in the Kibana menu
- Click *Import* and select the `.kibana_objects.ndjson` file from the project folder.
- Refresh the Kibana window to apply the changes.


For the Manticore Kibana instance:

- Go to *Discover* in the Kibana menu
- Set `test` as the value for the `Index pattern` input field
- Click *Next step*
- Select `@timestamp` in the `Time Filter` select field
- Click *Create index pattern*


### Explore the Dashboards

Once the setup is complete, explore the imported dashboards and visualizations based on the indexed log data. Navigate to *Dashboard* or *Visualize* in the Kibana menu.

### Stopping the Environment

To stop and remove all containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
